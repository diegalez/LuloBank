Automation challenge Lulo
Introduction ðŸš€
Automation made for a challenge, with transactions to call API.

* This challenge is created to consume through the GET , POST and DELETE methods the service http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/
and validate different answers that it can answer.

+ Sensations: The api is very unstable which makes it a bit difficult to control when one response or another is going to come out, the api does not have the error messages well mapped and it does not control much errors either to have a wide variety of possibilities to test the messages or codes that returns, however it was a big challenge to automate this API.

Feature: Get Post And Delete employees by api

  @GetEmployees
  Scenario Outline: As a user, I want consult the employees through services to carry out this process more quickly
    Given I make the connection to the api "<Uri>" with resource api "<ResourceApi>"
    When execute the method "<RequestType>"
    Then I see that the state is returned "<StatusCode>"
    And I check if the user "<Employee>" exists among all employees
    Examples:
    | RequestType | Uri                                      |ResourceApi| StatusCode |Employee             |
    | GET         | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1   |employees  |200         |Michael Silva        |

  @CreateEmployee
  Scenario Outline: As a user, I want create the employees through services to carry out this process more quickly
    Given I make the connection to the api "<Uri>" with resource api "<ResourceApi>"
    When execute the method "<RequestType>" to create the employee "<Employee>" with salary "<Salary>" and "<Age>"
    Then I see that the state is returned "<StatusCode>"
    And Check if the "<Employee>" was created successfully
    Examples:
      | RequestType | Uri                                      |ResourceApi| StatusCode |Employee         |Salary     |Age|
      | POST        | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/  |create     |200         |Diego Zapata     |12321      |25 |
      | POST        | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/  |create     |200         |                 |12321      |25 |
      | POST        | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/  |create     |200         |Diego Zapata     |12321      |-25|
      | POST        | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/  |create     |200         |Diego Zapata     |500.000.001|25 |
      | POST        | http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/  |create     |200         |5113213221       |100.000    |25 |

  @GetAnEmployee
  Scenario Outline: As a user, I want consult one employee through services to carry out this process more quickly

    When execute the method "<RequestType>"
    Then I see that the state is returned "<StatusCode>"
    And I check if the "<Employee>" exists
    And I check the message "<Message>"
    Examples:
